# hi there, it's andrewliamc

## About Me:
I’m a <strong>self-taught web developer</strong> and designer with 5 years of experience helping small businesses and solo entrepreneurs build clean, modern, and effective websites. I specialize in front-end development with solid back-end knowledge, allowing me to create fully responsive, user-friendly digital experiences tailored to each client’s needs.

One of my proudest achievements is building a custom e-commerce site integrated with a CMS and Stripe for seamless management and payments — giving the client full control of their business operations online.

What I bring to the table:

	👨‍💻	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Next.js
	💰	Stripe integration & ChatGPT API
	👨‍🎨	Figma & Relume for sleek, strategic design

Clients describe me as kind, patient, and knowledgeable — someone who listens deeply, communicates clearly, and delivers solutions that actually work.

Let’s work together to bring your vision to life!
